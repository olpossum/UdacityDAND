    "## Udacity OpenStreetMap Project: New Orleans, LA\n",
    "---\n",
    "For this project I chose to study New Orleans, LA and some of the surrounding municipalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained a raw .osm map from Mapzen:\n",
    "https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/new-orleans_louisiana/\n",
    "\n",
    "This raw .osm file was ~1.2GB uncompressed. In order to reduce processing times I used the sample osm code from the project outline with a k value = 10 to obtain a subset of the larger database. This code can be found with my project in the file sample_osm.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Purpose\n",
    "This project serves to demonstrate my understanding of skills learned in the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Lesson: Data Wrangling.  In this lesson we studied the process of auditing a dataset and ways to correct/standardize a dataset to make it easer to process.  Using OpenStreetMap data can be problematic due to many types of human error when entering the data into the database.  In order to gain confidence in our dataset we need to assess the data quality, audit the data based off of conditions we discover, define a set of operations necessary to correct the data and programatically clean the data up to our standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Data Quality\n",
    "It is necessary to first assess the quality of the data we are working with, to determine what we might need to do clean it up.  The best ways to do this is to come up with some tests that programatically parse the data and display relevant information to us about the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by taking a look at the number of unique users that have contributed to this dataset.  In order to accomplish this I adapted the code used in our lessons to work with my dataset as users.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 1: Out of Memory!\n",
    "The first major problem that I encountered is that my computer was quickly running out of memory while parsing through the dataset, even with smaller dataset samples. After some research on the Udacity forums I found a post from Myles [Here!](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/lingering-questions-as-i-head-into-sql-portion-of-p3/237251/27) that greatly reduced the memory usage of my code. Code snippet can be seen below for reference!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def get_element(osm_file, tags=('node', 'way')):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Yield element if it is the right type of tag\"\"\"\n",
    "    \"\"\"This code handles a single parse event at a time\n",
    "        and then clears it from memory after it has returned it!\"\"\"\n",
    "    context = ET.iterparse(osm_file, events=('start', 'end'))\n",
    "    _, root = next(context)\n",
    "    for event, elem in context:\n",
    "        if event == 'end' and elem.tag in tags:\n",
    "            yield elem\n",
    "            root.clear()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After integrating this into my users.py code, I was able to run through my 128MB dataset with no memory issues. I had to implement this logic in each unique piece of code used in this project in order to keep memory usage manageable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unique Users\n",
    "After running users.py on my dataset I noticed of couple of interesting things.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there are 563 unique users that have contributed to this dataset.  Thats alot of users! Second, it looks like there are a couple of bots that contribute to the dataset e.g. 'woodpeck_fixbot' and 'woodpeck_repair'.  I wonder how many contributions these bots are responsible for compared to other unique users?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tags Assessment\n",
    "In the data wrangling lesson we took a look at all of the tags in the dataset to get an idea as to how the related \"k\" values are formatted.  This will help us in auditing our datset later.  I adapted the tags.py code from the lesson to work with this dataset.  Running this code against this dataset should give us a count of the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"lower\", for tags that contain only lowercase letters and are valid.\n",
    "2. \"lower_colon\", for otherwise valid tags with a colon in their names.\n",
    "3. \"problemchars\", for tags with problematic characters.\n",
    "4. \"other\", for other tags that do not fall into the other three categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running tags.py I got the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{'lower': 65769, 'lower_colon': 68988, 'other': 31490, 'problemchars': 1}`\n",
    "\n",
    "And looking at some samples of the categories:\n",
    "```\n",
    "lower:\n",
    "railway\n",
    "name\n",
    "place\n",
    "railway\n",
    "highway\n",
    "\n",
    "lower_colon:\n",
    "addr:street\n",
    "addr:housenumber\n",
    "addr:city\n",
    "addr:housenumber\n",
    "addr:postcode\n",
    "addr:state\n",
    "addr:street\n",
    "\n",
    "other:\n",
    "gnis:ST_num\n",
    "gnis:ST_alpha\n",
    "gnis:County_num\n",
    "gnis:Class\n",
    "gnis:County\n",
    "\n",
    "problemchars:\n",
    "payment method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a good idea of different tags formatting we are up against when we go to audit our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auditing Data\n",
    "Now that we have a general idea of what our data looks like, we need validate the data with a structured audit. In our lessons we learned the following elements to look at when auditing a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validity: Conforms to a Schema\n",
    "- Accuracy: Conforms to Gold Standard - need a set of trusted data for comparison\n",
    "- Completeness: All records present\n",
    "- Consistency: Matches other data in dataset\n",
    "- Uniformity: All data use same units?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that we want to import this data into a SQL database, we should focus first on **Data Validity**.  In particular we need to ensure that our data conforms to a common schema that allows it to play nice with SQL.  Second, we will need to focus on **Consistency** and **Uniformity**.  Since our data is heavily modified by human hands, it is very likely that it is riddled with abbreviations, typos and formatting errors.  This will prevent us from getting accurate aggregations once the data is imported into a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Street Names, In Particular\n",
    "Following along with the data cleaning lesson, lets take a look at the street names component of the dataset.  This can be done by adapting the audit.py code from our lessons, which takes a look at expected street types (e.g. Street/Avenue) and flags when it finds street types that are not epected.  Additionally we can create a mapping to keep track of expected street types that may be abbreviated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the audit.py script with the expected street types as left from the lesson revealed another issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 2: Louisiana Expectations\n",

    "Here is a snippet from the initial output:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Problem 3: Abbreviations\n",

    "All of these abbreviations should be cleaned, replacing St with Street. This will result in a more consistent dataset. Likewise, abbreviations for Avenue, Road, Loop, Boulevard and Highway should also be cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data\n",
    "Now that we have performed our audit, we can begin cleaning the data and importing it into out SQL database!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we covered in our lessons, I will need to parse the OSM XML map file and transform it into tabular format. This will allow the file to be written to .csv files for importation into a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for this transformation is as follows:\n",
    "- Use iterparse to iteratively step through each top level element in the XML\n",
    "- Shape each element into several data structures using a custom function\n",
    "- Utilize a schema\n",
    "- Clean the Data\n",
    "- Write each data structure to the appropriate .csv files\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data.py file provided in our lessons as a starting point, I was able to clean and shape the data all in one step. The cleaning done \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning Street Names\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning operation I chose was to ensure that all of the street type abbreviations (e.g Ave. Av. St.) were changed to the full street type (e.g. Avenue, Street). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 3: (Pot) Holy Abbreviations\n",
    "After cleaning the data using data.py the first time I noticed that the 'St' regex key also changed all of the abbreviations for \"Saint\" (St.) to Street!  The state of Louisiana is divided into \"Parishes\" that take the place of what would be \"Counties\" in most other states.  The roman catholic origins of this system result in many of the Parishes being named after Saints (e.g. Saint Tammany Parish, Saint Charles Parish etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for this issue was to implement checks in my cleaning routines that ensure only street names are attempted to be cleaned. Previously I was passing all tags to my cleaning function.  This worked!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Data into SQL Databaase\n",
    "Following the creation of my cleaned, shaped .csv files I needed to import them into a SQL database.  I used a discussion [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/creating-db-file-from-csv-files-with-non-ascii-unicode-characters/174958/2) on the Udacity forums as a reference to manually import the csv files into the database.\n",

    "### Improving the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that this dataset could be improved further with some additional orginazation of the data into more discreet types.  For both the nodes_tags and ways_tags tables, the tag type 'regular' makes up the majority of the entries.  This does not really tell us a whole lot and limits our opportunities to learn from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to implement this would be to audit the data using additional regex keys to get a clear picture of the relation between 'key' and 'value' in the tags.  If patterns begin to emerge, for example there are a number of occurences of 'key'=highway, 'value'=turning_circle, 'type'=regular, then we could assign a new type to tags that fit that pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of this lesson and project, the importance of data auditing and cleaning is very clear to me.  Without a good test plan and cleaning blueprint it becomes very difficult to fully understand messy data.  Formatting errors can skew statistics, and vague categories can limit visibility into how the data is organized. I look forward to applying the skills learned in this lesson to future data analysis opportunities!\n",
